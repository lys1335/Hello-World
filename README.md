# 読書筆記(Reading Notes)



​        年近不惑，庸庸碌碌。心浮于世，烦躁不断。为使自己沉下来，静下来，特找书来读。读书的同时再做些笔记，想来可以提升下写作，也能作为部分创作素材，想来应该不错。

​		Nearing the end of the 30's years, mediocrity and boredom. My heart is floating in the world, and I am constantly irritated. In order to make myself sink down and quiet down, I am looking for books to read. At the same time, I think I can improve my writing and use it as part of my creative material, so I think it should be good.

​        由于算是半个程序员，所以还是想读一些计算机专业类的书，或者一些有实际干货内容的书。当然书非读而不知优劣。如有推荐，幸甚。

​		Since I am half a programmer, I still want to read some computer professional books, or some books with actual dry content. Of course, you do not know the advantages and disadvantages unless read over the book. If you have a recommendation, thank you.

​        记笔记书单罗列如下，后续更新再追加。

​		The list of had noted books is listed below and will be added in subsequent updates.
